## About ME !
### My hobbies are painting or drawing, travelling, swimming. I also enjoy  learning new languages such as french or spanish. I know some basic words in spanish and I can speak french pretty well, however not fluently. I have learn digital teacnololy last year and I know basic skills to do coding and to use some tools like blender. 

### I love digital tecnology. I enjoy working with htmls, coding and all other instereting things. I have made websites and also a keychain as 3d modelling from blender last year. However, I often find digital tecnology very difficult. Specially when there are some promblems or bugs. I choosed digital tecnology  to be successful in digital work in future. However, I am stil not confrimed about my future carrer. 

## Countries I want to travel 
* Switerland- I love the nature there and want to know more about switerland.
